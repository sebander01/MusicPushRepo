# MusicPushRepo
 The third game I made in under a week this game is designed to time music with a jumping game in a whimsicle world inspired by alice in wonderland. Made in second year third semester. As seems to be the theme with this after thought uploads library is ziped to actually allow this thing to upload please unzip to use in unity.
